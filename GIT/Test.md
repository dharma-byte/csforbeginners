# Working on Conflicts

Create a Repo

Now create a simple js file(index.js) and some script

window.alert("helloo, I'm Dharma");
window.alert("hi, I'm Maniraj");

Create a branch in the repo with Yourname/feature1

Switch to this new branch,

Edit the second message

And try to merge this new branch with the main branch where you can see the conflicts.

Try to resolve the conflicts.
